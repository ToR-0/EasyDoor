# EasyDoor
This software technically acts as a backdoor, but all I use it for is to annoy my brother. :) It uses C#'s socket tools in order to listen and connect to a TCP connection, and when connected send a variety of commands.

## Features:

 **All built in C# with no NuGet packages**

 1. **Shutdown** - *Shutdown the computer remotely*
 2. **Minecraft** - *Closes all instances of Java and Lunar Client.*
 3. **Monkey** - *Opens 100 windows of Chromium with assorted monkey pics. That's a lot of memory.
 4. **Custom Downloads** - *If these features don't suit your needs, code your own custom Windows executable and execute it by providing a URL. *

## Coming soon:

 - [ ] MacOS TCP connections w/ Java (Haven't learned socket yet)
 - [ ] Better Windows UI (C# is a yucky language for UI)
 - [ ] More features

 ## Thanks for using my tool!
